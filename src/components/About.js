            <h3>A dedicated Developer based in Germany üìç</h3>
            <p>
            As a Junior Developer, 
            I bring a strong skill set 
            in HTML, CSS, JavaScript/Typescript, React, 
            and Python. <br/><br/> I specialize in 
            designing, building, and maintaining 
            responsive front-end applications as well as 
            developing back-end solutions with Python. 
            My experience mostly includes working with 
            PyTorch, giving me exposure to machine 
            learning and data-driven applications. <br/><br/> 
            I focus on writing clean, optimized code 
            and leveraging modern frameworks, tools, 
            and techniques. I thrive in collaborative 
            environments, contributing to cross-functional 
            teams to deliver outstanding web applications 
            and innovative solutions.
